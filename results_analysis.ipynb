       "      <td>Adopt open source software.\\nSo, we think there are a couple reasons why open source software is less preferable, than proprietary software, or other software that is made by development companies and then kept the code is kept closed, so that other people can't manipulate it and do other things to it, without being sued for violation of intellectual property.\\nSo, the first is that we think that open source software is simply less safe than comparable software.\\nThe reason for this is few things, first: recognize that the nature of open source software is such, that it's open, the code is open for anyone that wants to access it, to manipulate it in any which way, to make edits to it, to change it, and to put it back out there for other people to use.\\nSo, you can take someone's platform, you can take someone's programming, you can manipulate a little bit, and then put it out.\\nUsually this this is like heralded as a good thing, because it means that there's more opportunity for collaboration between different programmers, and different companies, and that it means that you're more likely to get a diverse, more user centered, product, than you are otherwise, if you just have kind of a black box, that has the information, that works in a certain way, and can't be edited in any way.\\nBut the problem with this is that it also means, that it's incredibly easy for someone to take this software, manipulate it in such a way, that there's a couple of lines of of a malicious virus, or some other adware, or something like this, into open source software, and then to go from there, to put it online, publish it as if it was the same thing it always was, and from there cause any number of computers to be infiltrated with the virus, or what have you, because it's very easy to hide a couple of lines of code into an entire software program, and because of this, we think it's simply the case that you're less likely to have a guarantee of safety with open source software.\\nThe other thing is that we think that, if you're using open source software on a platform to store information or what have you, again you' you're more prone to be hacked than you are through proprietary software, because all of the information about the coding of the software is is publicly out there.\\nAnd it means that, at any time, someone can try and hack into that software.\\nThe second reason, why we think open source software is less preferable than proprietary software, is that it simply is less profitable for businesses to adopt, and to create.\\nThe first reason is that proprietary software is software that you're more likely to have robust customer support around, because it's made by one company, it is a streamlined process, which means that the development goals of that product are very narrowly tailored to suit a certain purpose.\\nWhat this means is that you're less likely to get software, that has a diverse amount of different futures and options, but doesn't really work as a whole product as well.\\nBecause, it's very difficult to direct how these products are going to be created, if it's made in a collaborative form between a number of coders, but if you have proprietary software being developed by one company, with one united goal, that is being directed from the top down, we think it's more likely that you're going to you're going to get not only useful customer support, but you're more likely to get a product that has a very well designed, and narrowly tailored purpose, that we think is more effective for businesses and for individuals.\\nWe also think, that as far as development is concerned, open source software is simply less profitable than proprietary software, because it's more easy for people to get the software for free, it's more easy for people to make manipulations of this software, make it better and then undermine your customer base.\\nBecause of all these things, we simply think that as a business, as as a financial decision, it makes more sense to create proprietary software, that you then lease or sell to other people and they use through your business.\\nWe think, from a business perspective, if you're going to adopt software, it's much safer to adopt proprietary software, and it's much more likely that you'll get good customers support to make that software useful.\\nFor all these reasons, we should not adopt open source software.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We should subsidize agriculture.\\nIn this round, we're gonna make three main arguments about why subsidizing agriculture is a positive action the government should take.\\nThe first argument that we want to make is that reliance on domestic production is important.\\nFirstly, we think that having the domestic production of agriculture, the ability to feed yourself internally and to produce all the agriculture you need to feed your population, without reaching out to the international world, is an incredibly secure thing for a state to have.\\nWere there to be international conflict, were there to be some sort of internal disputes amongst countries that provide the agriculture, were there to be some sort of action in some sort of natural disaster that damaged a country, the ability to control the infrastructure that allows agriculture to boom is a benefit.\\nBut more importantly, as far as a health perspective, fresher produce comes when it is from more regional areas.\\nAnd so having regional farms and regional food chains is allows you to provide fresher produce at lower cost and improve the health of the population.\\nAnd this is higher quality of life comes from this type of domestic production and is especially important in today's day and age, given the incredibly high rates of obesity, the the incredible scarcity of food in some areas.\\nEven in countries like the united states, there are food deserts where you cannot get this type of fresh produce.\\nAllowing for more subsidization subsidization of agriculture to ensure that local areas have some sort of access to fresh produce is something that is beneficial for security and for health.\\nSecondly, we think that this is a dying sector that should be protected.\\nConsolidation and mechanization of small farms has driven down the amount of jobs in the sector, but it's also created monopolistic actors that have huge amounts of influence on the agriculture industry.\\nSmall family farms that have been going on for generations are being wiped out by these monopolistic actors, and we think that we should subsidize these small farms to protect and to allow them to be more competitive in a monopolistic landscape.\\nWe think that these farms have a right to exist, that they providing valuable resources to their areas for generations in some instances, and that we should not allow monopolies to reign supreme in this sector.\\nFinally, we think there's a necessity of current subsidies.\\nEven if you don't think that in, in theory, these types of subsidies are beneficial for society, the fact that they do exist in the status quo, that we already subsidize agriculture, is something that is important to keep in mind.\\nMany businesses rely on these current subsidies to make ends meet, to to be able to provide for their workers, to be able to pay their workers, to provide their food at a competitive price, and they've been planning with these subsidies in mind, producing and creating outputs with those subsidies in mind.\\nWe think if you were to remove these subsidies, as the government side would do, you're likely to see a large amount of job loss and more food deserts, because they're because when these businesses no longer have this source of income, they not only need to drive up prices, but they need to do things like cut down on their amount of production, cut down on the amount of employees they have, all these types of things that harm plans that agriculture industry has made in the past.\\nWe think it is once that aid has been given, once aid has been promised, as it has in this instance, we think it's unjust to repeal that aid, as people have planned with that aid in mind.\\nThey've made long-term choices about how they're going to behave with that aid in mind, and pulling the rug out from under them is only going to make an industry that's already crucial, but also in incredibly delicate state, even more damaged.\\nFor these reasons, we should subsidize agriculture.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We should subsidize single parents.\\nIn this round we're gonna make two main arguments about why we think it's important to subsidize single parents.\\nThe first one we wanna talk about is about mitigating harms of single parenthood.\\nSo recognize as an overview to this point that many single parents did not choose to have their child but they still are responsible for that child's well being whether this is because they couldn't afford to have an abortion, or it's because they were living in an area where you couldn't afford an abortion, or several other reasons you may not have fully consented to having that child.\\nWe think there are many many of the harms that come of being a single parent like the harms that are accrued on children in single parent households are due to financial limitations that do not apply to many traditional families or families with duel with duel incomes.\\nFor example: just an overall lack of money from single income which means that children are often forced to be fed less, they're forced to have lower quality of housing, they're forced to have lower quality of medical care, all these things that are accrued that are simply impacts of poverty but are duplicated when you're spreading on already low income between two individuals.\\nThere's also a lack of time for to help students with school or to spend money on things like extracurricular activities that are meant to build up a child's opportunities and things like this.\\nWe think that subsidizing these families is important to protect the children.\\nEven if you don't think that single parents should have children, if you think that children are born if you think that parents should just either have an abortion or not have sex until they're married or whatever reason, if you just fundamentally don't believe that these people should have children, that children are born into the situations are not something that they choose.\\nNo child is born saying I want to be a born to a single parent, nor do they have any sort of ability to choose that thing.\\nWe think subsidizing helps to even a playing field that was set by the lottery of birth.\\nWe think it makes up for a cosmic injustice that has been done to the children of single parents.\\nWe think the state is obligated to protect those in the state especially those that are most vulnerable, people that have that that have had harms done onto them through no fault of their own.\\nBut secondarily, we want to talk about freedom for family planning.\\nDuel families are an idea based on outdated patriarchal notions.\\nThe idea that you must have a breadwinner in the fatherly role and a domestic person in the motherly role.\\nWe think that parenthood is something that many people think is core to the good life.\\nThere are people that fundamentally believe that in order to live a fulfilling and meaningful life, they must have a child and we don't think you should have access to that type of self-actualization limited by financial reasons.\\nOften these financial and oftentimes these financial limitations are not the fault of the people themselves but rather of the situations they were born into, of the level of poverty they were in when they first started in their lives, things that are very hard to break out of.\\nWe don't think that financial capacity is equal to parental capacity and we think the same is true in the other direction.\\nWe think that there are plenty of parents out there, plenty of dual parent households, in which children are neglected and harmed and aren't shown the love that these other people, these single parents, could otherwise give to those children and just because those people have money does not mean that they have moral integrity.\\nIt does not mean that they have any sort of knack for raising a child or anything like that.\\nBut there are good wholesome people in this world who are limited by financial limitations beyond their control who'd be excellent parents and given the lack of those in the world, I don't think that we should be discouraging it by not providing these people with a subsidy.\\nFor these reasons, we should subsidize single parents.</td>\n",

       "117   Adopt open source software.\\nSo, we think there are a couple reasons why open source software is less preferable, than proprietary software, or other software that is made by development companies and then kept the code is kept closed, so that other people can't manipulate it and do other things to it, without being sued for violation of intellectual property.\\nSo, the first is that we think that open source software is simply less safe than comparable software.\\nThe reason for this is few things, first: recognize that the nature of open source software is such, that it's open, the code is open for anyone that wants to access it, to manipulate it in any which way, to make edits to it, to change it, and to put it back out there for other people to use.\\nSo, you can take someone's platform, you can take someone's programming, you can manipulate a little bit, and then put it out.\\nUsually this this is like heralded as a good thing, because it means that there's more opportunity for collaboration between different programmers, and different companies, and that it means that you're more likely to get a diverse, more user centered, product, than you are otherwise, if you just have kind of a black box, that has the information, that works in a certain way, and can't be edited in any way.\\nBut the problem with this is that it also means, that it's incredibly easy for someone to take this software, manipulate it in such a way, that there's a couple of lines of of a malicious virus, or some other adware, or something like this, into open source software, and then to go from there, to put it online, publish it as if it was the same thing it always was, and from there cause any number of computers to be infiltrated with the virus, or what have you, because it's very easy to hide a couple of lines of code into an entire software program, and because of this, we think it's simply the case that you're less likely to have a guarantee of safety with open source software.\\nThe other thing is that we think that, if you're using open source software on a platform to store information or what have you, again you' you're more prone to be hacked than you are through proprietary software, because all of the information about the coding of the software is is publicly out there.\\nAnd it means that, at any time, someone can try and hack into that software.\\nThe second reason, why we think open source software is less preferable than proprietary software, is that it simply is less profitable for businesses to adopt, and to create.\\nThe first reason is that proprietary software is software that you're more likely to have robust customer support around, because it's made by one company, it is a streamlined process, which means that the development goals of that product are very narrowly tailored to suit a certain purpose.\\nWhat this means is that you're less likely to get software, that has a diverse amount of different futures and options, but doesn't really work as a whole product as well.\\nBecause, it's very difficult to direct how these products are going to be created, if it's made in a collaborative form between a number of coders, but if you have proprietary software being developed by one company, with one united goal, that is being directed from the top down, we think it's more likely that you're going to you're going to get not only useful customer support, but you're more likely to get a product that has a very well designed, and narrowly tailored purpose, that we think is more effective for businesses and for individuals.\\nWe also think, that as far as development is concerned, open source software is simply less profitable than proprietary software, because it's more easy for people to get the software for free, it's more easy for people to make manipulations of this software, make it better and then undermine your customer base.\\nBecause of all these things, we simply think that as a business, as as a financial decision, it makes more sense to create proprietary software, that you then lease or sell to other people and they use through your business.\\nWe think, from a business perspective, if you're going to adopt software, it's much safer to adopt proprietary software, and it's much more likely that you'll get good customers support to make that software useful.\\nFor all these reasons, we should not adopt open source software.  \n",

can the tenure is so crucial in ensuring that good teachers are in our public school systems and are allowing our children to learn in the most efficacious way possible?\\nSo first thing is teacher recruitment.\\nIn the status quo, teachers face low wages, they're often undervalued by society, especially by parents that have to interact with them that blame the teachers for the problems that their children have, and more importantly, you can bet unions all across the western world, especially teacher unions, are being attacked on a massive scale, which means that their ability to organize, their ability to get better benefits, their ability to increase their wages, and their ability to get protections that are necessary are now being limited because of the attack on unions that our current because of blame that people place on unions for increased taxes, etcetera etcetera.\\nThis given that this is the case, we think that when someone enters college and someone needs to get a degree in order to become a teacher, when they're thinking about whether or not that degree is worthwhile, we think that many people simply don't see teaching as a profession that in the long run is going to be able to pay off, is going to provide enough money to make their college education worth it, and to make it so that they can live a comfortable life.\\nTenure is an incentive that people can have that drives them into education.\\nTenure allows for job security that simply does not exist in almost any other part of our society, in any other work force in our society.\\nGiven that this is the case, we think that tenure can be an immense tool for motivating people to get into education, and we don't think that education is something that people simply never want to do, but we think that when people have to make real trade offs between whether or not they're going to get a higher or lower wage, this is something can meaningfully motivate them towards choosing teaching over, say, economics or business.\\nSecondly, teacher retention.\\nBecause recognize, not every teacher gets tenure.\\nOnly the best teachers get tenure.\\nOnly the teachers that prove they can educate in a good way, and that they can keep students engaged in the classroom, are able to get tenure.\\nGiven that this is the case, we think that these are the teachers that are most likely going to get poached by other private schools or private industry.\\nAnd again, the ability to have job security is something that is beneficial for teachers in the status quo, and is something that allows teachers to be retained, because you don't only want teachers to come in and work hard for a brief period of time, but you want teachers to breed a culture in an educational system that is one that strives for students to learn, that gets them excited about learning, and I think the way that you do this this for continuity of teachers and through ensuring that you can retain the best teachers that you have in your system.\\nWithout having tenure, it makes it impossible to lock teachers up for a long period of time, and it makes it so that other sorts of job opportunities that present to that are presented to them, say working in a private school rather than working in a public school, that pays higher wages and gets better benefits, we think that when those things are opportunities that teachers have, you can't simply give away tenure that these teachers have just because some teachers abuse it, just because some teachers get through the cracks and get tenure when they don't deserve this.\\nWe think the vast majority of teachers that receive tenure our worthy teachers that are working hard and we think that if you reform the tenure system and you make it less strong, you're simply not going to get as many qualified teachers applying or working in these schools it harms our student and harms everyone's future.\\nFor those reasons, we don't think that teacher we think that teacher tenure brings more harm than it brings good.</td>\n",

       "      <td>-ot abolish the needle exchange programs.\\nSo in this debate we're gonna make two main arguments: the first is about public health and the second is the principle behind drug use and drug criminalization and why we think it's problematic and ultimately is not a reason to abolish the needle exchange program.\\nOkay, so firstly on public health.\\nWe would say that no matter what a person does as far as drugs they choose to use, or what they do with their body, or how they interact with the world around them, that person is still first and foremost a citizen of the state in which they're governed and because they are part of that state we think the state has overriding obligations to them, as a human being and as a citizen, that must be upheld.\\nAnd we think that one of those obligations is to their health and their well being.\\nSo even if someone does something like uses drugs, we don't think that this means that they are now excluded from the social contract that governs interactions between people and the state, we don't think that that means that they should be condemned to the health disasters that can come without the needle exchange program.\\nSo let's walk through what some of these are and why to abolish this program would be incredibly problematic for public health.\\nSo firstly the reason the needle exchange program exists is because when people don't have these types of programs they resort, they don't, you know, stop using drugs all of a sudden because they don't have clean needles, they just continue to use the same needles that they've been using or they you take needles from other people and these needles end up oftentimes having diseases attached to them.\\nSo one common disease as the transfer of HIV is very common between people that are using drugs and use needles and share needles between each other.\\nNow, these diseases that spread through needle use are incredibly like problematic.\\nThese aren't just simple diseases, short term illnesses, these are diseases that can have long term and major health ramifications in a person's life and could ultimately lead to death if not if not treated properly, and drug users of those that are probably most likely to not get the treatment that they need in order to stay healthy to begin with.\\nAnd these these diseases don't just impact the drug users themselves.\\nFirstly when they end up going to the hospital, when they end up going to get their health, when they end up going somewhere to try and get treatment, that bill is almost always passed on to the public.\\nAnd the reason for this is because drug users, especially people that are getting HIV from their heroine needles, these are people that oftentimes don't have health insurance but the hospitals can't refuse to treat them in these life threatening situations, and therefore that bill gets passed on to the state.\\nThe other thing that's important to recognize is that if someone uses a uses a needle that is unclean, and they get HIV from it, they can spread this disease to other people in their interactions.\\nInnocent people that chose to have sexual relations with these drug users, people that clearly have no harm, have brought no harm upon themselves, that have done nothing to warrant that type of harm I'm now going to be harmed because we take away these programs.\\nAll these people are a part of the social contract.\\nAll these people are citizens of the state the state should keep public health is a primary concern because of the massive ramifications, especially in regards to needle exchange programs.\\nSo the second thing we wanna talk about briefly is that we would say that all the arguments that are made about these people are heroin users, or these people are drug users, they're breaking the law and therefore they don't deserve to have this type of treatment, they don't deserve to have this, this leads them to use drugs more often, firstly the fact that you can get a clean needle is not a motivating factor to do heroin for any normal person.\\nNormal people don't just suddenly decide: \" oh well, now that I can get the needle, that is the meaningful tipping point for me using heroin \".\\nWe just don't think that people behave that way, and furthermore we would say that those prohibition, most of these prohibitions are overwhelmingly targeted at marginalized communities in the status quo, and overwhelmingly harm those communities and unjust manner.\\nWe don't think that these types of justifications mean that people need to be condemned to some severe diseases such as HIV.\\nWe don't think that abolishing needle exchange programs will lower the rate of drug use, we think it'll only increase the rate of disease from drug use.\\nAnd for these reasons we should not abolish needle exchange programs.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We should cancel the social security tax, and we should cancel it not because it is ideal in its current form, but because of any alternatives that could possibly exist would be inferior.\\nAny feasible alternatives would simply not be good enough, and social security is so important to so many people.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, that we keep and await it.\\nFirst let's start by talking about some of the things that we would defend.\\nWe think it's perfectly comfortable that since we're defending the side of keeping the social security tax as it currently is, we can still defend minor changes, for example, ending the contribution caps and things like that that make it a more financially salient solution to the baby boomer problem.\\nSo, now that this has been established, let's talk about why social security is so important to the lives of so many senior citizens.\\nRecognize that before the passage of social security by the FDR administration, millions upon millions of senior citizens died in poverty, with no money at all to their name.\\nWhy is this true?\\nBecause senior citizens do not as they are retired, obviously, don't have money to take care of themselves.\\nThey don't have a way to generate income and they don't have a way to just take care of themselves in very basic ways.\\nSo this puts them in a position of extreme dependency out of no fault of their own, simply out of biological necessity.\\nBut, additionally, the money that seniors make and the money that seniors save becomes less valuable over time as goods become more expensive and as inflation rises, so maybe and additionally, as minimum wage laws and things like that also generally progress.\\nSo this is important because it means that even if you made a good amount of money in your living, it's still difficult to save that money because you're going to have even if you save your money up, you're still not going to have enough money, likely, to afford the basic things that you need to enjoy a good quality of life once you become a senior citizen.\\nSo, now that we've established that social security is incredibly important, let's next talk about why it is necessary that we keep it in the form it is.\\nSo first, I think it's highly unlikely that we would ever actually see a more progressive system like the one that our government described, and I think the reason for this is because the political incentives against social security are oftentimes already incredibly large and that there is not that many more incentives to do those kinds of things.\\nI think that the much more likely scenario that we would see play out would be a privatization scheme.\\nSo, this would be absolutely horrible, and it would be absolutely horrible for several reasons.\\nFirst and foremost, I think that when you create a profit motive for this industry, rather than relying on the government to make investments and not having to worry about profit, when you have a profit seeking industry taking care of this, they're more likely to take higher risk investments, and they'll take those higher risk investments because they have a possible promise of a higher payout.\\nNow, this may sound okay because it means that senior citizens are going to get more money, but I ultimately think that this is a big problem because when you're taking a risk with someone else's money, you are additionally also likely to be less careful with this.\\nSo this is incredibly bad because I think that what this will likely therefore end up doing is whenever you get to a time of a recession or even in non-times of recession, you're going to have people taking risks with senior citizens' life savings, things that they depend on to survive, and that's simply not something that we can accept, so that's not going to work.\\nBut additionally, privatization is also going to be more expensive for people because even if you're not going to have to pay the social security tax or the like, you're still going to have to take things like manager fees, you have to pay usually like basis points off of like basis points off of the money that you make or investments that you make and things like that.\\nAnd oftentimes because of the higher costs of operating for the private sector and about how they have to make the profit, you're going to have to pay more for the exact same service that you're getting.\\nSo this is going to hurt poor people, and this is really bad because these poor people are the ones who rely on social security the most.\\nBut finally, I don't think that the using employer-funded systems are a very good solution because as we see in the status quo, employer funded pensions can oftentimes be ended or cut prematurely, which additionally leads to the harm that we are talking about to a whole lot of people.\\nSo for all of those reasons, we should definitely not cancel the social security tax.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We should not subsidize single parents.\\nSo to start, let's try to frame what the problem here is.\\nBy and large people who have children as like single parents can fall into like one or two categories: there's people who are by choice single parents, people who want to have a child but they're not dating anyone are married to anyone's they get donations, and on the second category of people, where it's not by choice.\\nWhere it's a result of an accidental pregnancy, maybe even like sexual assault or some other kind of like coercive situation, maybe like a religious like religious family, things like that that can coerce you into having a child even if you don't wanna have one.\\nSo the position that we're going to take is if you are having your child by choice and you're not able to support that child, if it's your choice then you're taking on the responsibilities of having another human being.\\nSo you need to be able to be responsible for that.\\nIf it's not by choice, rather than trying to deal with the consequences of all the financial consequences of an accidental pregnancy that results in single parenthood, we should instead more precisely focus our policies to actually attack the root of this problem.\\nOr in other words make it so that people aren't having like there's no single people aren't having children if they're not prepared for it as single parents in the first place.\\nSo what do we think that this would look like?\\nThis would be instead of taking the money that you used to subsidize single parents and instead using that to subsidize things like birth control, contraceptives, condoms, abortions if necessary.\\nBecause in a lot of this money could be used way more effectively.\\nObviously it takes a whole lot of money to raise a child if you're not ready for it, you have to, like whether it's like medical care, education expenses, food expenses, like clothing, like children are very very expensive.\\nThat much is obvious.\\nSo if you don't have a whole lot of money you're going to be heavily reliant on various forms of public assistance.\\nSo we can lessen dependence on that in more financially efficient ways by making it more likely that people just get abortions or people will have access to birth control that maybe they weren't able to access or afford before, and maybe just maybe we could even have mandatory sex education that would make it so that people are more likely to rely on those services in the first place.\\nI think that you would have a lot better of a situation because you would be saving a lot of money of course.\\nYou'd be saving money because it's just more economically efficient to to try to like prevent this problem in the first place.\\nBut it would also by and large be more moral and a lot of circumstances.\\nBecause a lot of people who have unwanted pregnancies or pregnancies were not prepared for pregnancies, are in like coercive situations.\\nThey're in financial financially coercive situations because maybe they can't afford an abortion, they live in some or maybe they live some part of the world, or somewhere in the united states even, where abortions are incredibly difficult to get or inaccessible, maybe birth control isn't accessible to them for various reasons.\\nSo by and large a lot of people who end up as single parents, they tend to be poor, they tend to be people and there's a reason for that.\\nBecause if you have less like financial, if you have less money you're not going to be able to spend that money to essentially terminate a pregnancy early if you need to.\\nSo I think that for all those reasons we should stop subsidizing single parents.</td>\n",

       "      <td>ADHD management brings more harm than good.\\nSo I think it's important in this debate that obviously there are going to be some benefits and some drawbacks to different types of ADHD management, but I think that what we're really looking at is what's going to be better or worse on balance.\\nSo we're going to tell you that using things like therapy and drugs to treat ADHD is ultimately going to do more harm, particularly for young people, than allowing them to grow up and learn to cope with this on their own.\\nSo two main arguments for you.\\nThe first is about over medication and the problems that it brings.\\nRecognize that in countries like the US and britain, hundreds of thousands of children have been put on to ADHD medications which fundamentally change their personality and how they look at the world.\\nWe tell you that oftentimes children who are on these drugs feel unhappy because they're not used to this new mental state and because they don't feel like themselves.\\nWe think that at the end of the day the unhappiness that this causes children it's going to do more damage to them growing up than it would to have to cope with this ADHD.\\nWe think that it's likely to lead to people questioning their self worth, people having a hard time connecting with their peers and their family, and that ultimately the disutility of this unhappiness is going to be greater than the utility created from the happiness of being able to focus on something a little bit longer.\\nWe also think that you're likely to see a loss of creativity as a result of this over medication.\\nThat young people are likely to lose out on talents that they might have developed otherwise and generally be less able to explore and develop themselves into the person that they ultimately want to become.\\nBut on top of that when we say over medication we think that doctors are often too quick to prescribe ADHD medications to parents who don't know how to deal with, perhaps, unruly children.\\nWe think that many times these drugs are a band-aid solution to get children to behave when what we really need to do is look at the root causes of their difficulty focusing or poor behavior.\\nWe think that, although not always, these drugs can be a crutch for lazy parenting or bad teachers and things like that and that what would really be best for the children would be to address the root cause rather than to just use these medications as an easy way to get out of a difficult problem.\\nOur second argument is about the long term drawbacks of relying on these different types of ADHD treatments so the other team tells you that in recent years the prevalence of ADHD has increased, but I'm going to push back on this idea.\\nWe tell you that it's very likely that in the past many people had ADHD and were able to cope with it either because society was different or because ultimately they were able to learn to cope with this and people around them were able to help them deal with it.\\nWe think that if society has changed that medicating people won't solve the ills that underlie the problem in society and that we need to identify those problems rather than just ask individual people to change everything about themselves.\\nBut in terms of these long term drawbacks, we think that it's likely that individuals will form a dependence on these medications.\\nThat when you learn how to cope with the world when you're taking adderall or ritalin, that it's very likely that you won't be able to cope with the world without those drugs.\\nSo when you give them to children in particular, you set them up for a lifetime of dependence on these medications.\\nNow they haven't been around that long.\\nWe don't know what the side effects might be of taking these medications for twenty, thirty, even forty years, and on top of that we tell you that it's likely to be inconvenient for people to continue to rely on them into adulthood at times when they need to travel or otherwise wouldn't be able to carry these drugs with them.\\nWe think that, if anything, the types of treatments that the other team tells you about prevent people from learning to cope with their condition in a way that they probably would without medication.\\nWe think that encouraging people to solve their problems from within would ultimately be preferable.\\nWe're willing to acknowledge that some people with very serious cases of ADHD might need these treatments but in general, we think they do more harm than good for most people.\\nThank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The american jobs act brought way more harm than good, for two big reasons: first because it led to an increase in the deficit, and an increase in the debt, and I think that this is bad, and wildly irresponsible, and second, because I think that it used up a lot of political capital, that necessarily came at the expense of better focused plans, that actually would lead to long term solutions to problems that we face.\\nSo, let's start by talking about the problem of debt and deficit.\\nI think that this is incredibly important, because whenever you you whenever you increase the deficit, it leads to, on a yearly basis, it leads to, overtime, a greater and greater accumulation of debt.\\nSo, this is a problem.\\nBecause eventually, you're going to have to pay off this debt.\\nWhen people lend you money, people eventually want that money back.\\nNot only do they want that money back, but they expect to get more money back than they originally got.\\nThat's the way in which this works.\\nSo, there's first obvious financial implication that is associated with this, because the status quo, with like american society, for a long time has been: oh we need to spend more money on something?\\nWell then, we'll just borrow more money.\\nOh we need to repay that money?\\nThen let's borrow more money.\\nSo first, this creates the problem with like over time, you're only going to see these costs go up and up, because borrowing money is in of itself an expensive act, and you're going to have to eventually pay that money back, and you're eventually losing more money, because you're going to pay that money back.\\nBut, this is also an unfair way in which like, the burden it's going to be putting on people, because the primary burden, of paying this money back, is going to be on younger americans, it is going to be on millennials, it's going to be on the next generation, and I think that's very very bad and very very irresponsible, because first, they're they're not the people who are primarily getting the benefits of this, like young people are not primarily the ones who are going to be the beneficiaries of these jobs, young people aren't going to be the ones that are actually going to get a lot of this like economic help as a result of this job and stimulus act, but those are the people who are going to have to pay for all this debt spending in the long run, and I think this is incredibly bad, because this isn't our fault.\\nIt's not young people's fault, that all of these costs are the recruited value, and it's not fair to put the spending all this who aren't not only benefiting the problem, but never really got a choice in this spending in the first place, because of the like m asymmetrical political power that younger people have.\\nI also think that that's like incredibly immoral.\\nBut, in addition to all of that, I also think that the american jobs act was bad, because of the way in which it used up a lot of political capital for a bad focus.\\nSo when you're trying to pass a bill, its the like the jobs act, I think then it was like very poorly focused, in that it focused on short term things, that aren't ultimately creating long term good jobs, like infrastructure projects, which may be good in some senses, but they're ultimately not going to actually lead to sustainable jobs, they're are not jobs that people can actually make a career out of, so that's not all that good.\\nBut, I additionally think that, it was primarily just repair focused in nature, it was primarily just repairing roads, repairing energy things, like that, and of repairing like energy grids and things like that, and like, I think that that's like important, because when you create like a new energy grid per se, you're just increasing our ability to rely on the ways in which we already get energy, like you're increasing our ability to rely on oil or gas or things like that.\\nWhat this does is it de de emphasizes a focus on alternative sources of energy.\\nWhen you repair roads, you increase the likelihood and ease of using a car, so people are going to be less likely to rely on alternative forms of education, of like transportation, things like that, and that's where a lot of this goes, and I think that all that bad.\\nSo for those reasons, the american jobs act was bad.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Same-sex marriage brings more good than harm.\\nNot allowing a couple of consensual adults to marry each other because other people disapprove of their relationship is the definition of absurd.\\nThe state has no business in telling me who I should live with.\\nThe ban on gay marriage isn't only discriminative to same-sex couples, it also humiliates them and refuses them the very basic dignity of acknowledging that their love is equal to that of any other couple.\\nTwo arguments in this speech: firstly, on discrimination by humiliation and secondly, on like what about religious people's feelings?\\nFirst argument: I have no intention to speak of whether marriage is a basic right or not.\\nAs far as I care, the state can say that as of today, no one gets married.\\nBut it seems fairly simple that if some people are allowed to marry, then everyone should be able to do so.\\nPersonally, I do not see any supreme importance in this institution.\\nI think that it's just a symbolic thing.\\nThe point is that the moment that this custom is adopted and even somewhat glorified by society, then it doesn't matter anymore.\\nThe fact that society awards this ritual with so much meaning and like is what gives it its meaning, because all of us want to feel a part of society.\\nAll of us want to go through the same rituals that everybody else goes through so that we feel we belong.\\nBy denying a certain group this ceremony, the message they are getting is: you guys are not a part of us, you're not like us, you're unwelcome.\\nJust like so many other cases of discrimination, it's not about the thing itself that's being denied, but rather about the feeling that this denial creates.\\nThink of a business that refuses to serve african americans, for example.\\nThere are a million other places that these people can go to, right?\\nBut the problem isn't that we've denied them this particular service, but that we've treated them as less deserving.\\nThis is what's so bad about discrimination, and this is also why when opposes to gay marriage innocently offer all kinds of alternatives that give it a different name, like civil partnership or whatever.\\nWe say, \" you know what, you can shove it. \"\\nExcuse my french.\\nThat's just like like the separate but equal policy.\\nSeparate isn't equal, and until we give it the exact same name, then this will continue to be used as a tool to distinguish between what's considered normal and what isn't, and this is unacceptable to us.\\nSecond argument: the main source of opposition to gay marriage has always been religion.\\nNow, there are those who claim that this isn't god's intention and blah blah.\\nI'm not honoring that with a reponse.\\nWhat I will do, though, is answer what I believe to be the strongest argument in regard to religion and that is that marriage is essentially a religious institution that requires , you know, registers that are often religious people and therefore, it's unfair to demand that they perform ceremonies or sign papers contrary to their religious , you know, beliefs or conscience.\\nSo, in short, let's call it the kim davis example, you know, after the famous clerk from kentucky.\\nOur answer is twofold.\\nA: we believe this is a simple that can easily be solved by saying that every public servant that can't fulfill his job according to the law and refuses to operate in an indiscriminatory fashion should just resign and remove himself in favor of someone who will.\\nBut but second answer, and that's the deeper answer that addresses also the balance between religious feelings and same-sex couples, we say we say the following: whenever there is a clash between two different lifestyles, or rather two groups that have the same set of beliefs that can't coexist, you know, where you can't please one group without harming the other, we should always prioritize the group that's not denying the other group.\\nTo put it in kindergarten terms, we ought prioritize whoever didn't start it.\\nSame-sex couples ask for no trouble.\\nThey're not trying to tell religious people how to lead their lives or that they shouldn't be religious.\\nThey just want to be treated equally.\\nAs far as they're concerned, everyone could have gotten along perfectly but sadly, they do not get symmetric treatment from the religious community that that to begin with, say that the problem is with the gays' lifestyles and they should change or be discriminated.\\nThis is not a legitimate belief belief.\\nThis is bullying and we should we should not be considerate towards it.\\nFor all of these, please propose.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Private universities bring more good than harm.\\nSo, when we're talking about private universities, we think that, any non public university is fair for debate within this round, we think that includes both for profit, and not for profit institutions, and so, we would say that on balance, between all those institutions, private universities bring more good than harm.\\nSo firstly, what we want to talk about is the right to education, and the right to choice in education, and secondly, we are going to talk about the tangible impacts that come from private universities.\\nSo firstly, on choice.\\nSo we think that, people should have the ability to choose where they want to go to be educated.\\nEducation is a crucial function of being able to be socially mobile, to be economically mobile within a society, and to better oneself, and attain employment.\\nSo, given that it is such a crucial part and a crucial aspect of life as we know it, within our societies, we think that people should have the autonomy and the choice, to choose where they're going to go.\\nWe would say that private universities, not only offer more variety to those choices, but also ensures that you have competition for public institutions.\\nWe think that, if all upper if all education, all university education, came simply from public institutions, we think there would be very little check on these institutions, and therefore we think that it's likely that these institutions would be prone to a number of harms, including corruption, trying to be trying to gain money through these public institutions.\\nWe think prices could possibly go up, when there's no check on the prices of these institutions, and more importantly when there's no competition to draw these students, you don't have to focus as hard and as much on trying to improve those educational institutions.\\nSo we think that, private universities are good, simply by their existence, regardless of whether or not there are external benefits, that we would say there are, simply because it provides competition that is desperately needed to check public institutions.\\nBut, what do we think are the true benefits a private universities?\\nSo, we think that private universities have the benefit of being able to draw upon: one, a very long history that allows for more donations, what this looks like tangibly is the fact that harvard, yale, and other ivy league, and non ivy league institutions are often much older than the public institutions that we have, which means that there's more prestige to these institutions, and it allows for a larger conglomeration of great minds in in our academic spheres, and insures that there was a long, and illustrious, history of donors that are willing to give to these institutions, and these institutions are crucial for academic scientific research, and things that allow for our society to progress.\\nMany of the advancements, that have come scientifically, have come from private universities, and private research, that is done by those universities, because these universities have a profit incentive oftentimes, to be as productive as possible, to produce as much research as possible, to have as much academic prestige as possible, because this is how they draw both more more donations, and how they draw undergraduates, who end up paying into the college itself.\\nWe think that, when there is this competition, when there's this competition, and a profit incentive that only private universities are going to have, within that you're more likely to get tangible academic research that has real benefits, things like, scientific progress, medical research that isn't driven simply by selling a product, but also motivated by being able to produce tangible gains for society writ large.\\nWe think that, the profit incentive, that these universities do, is different from private businesses, in that they're they're is not simply trying to sell a product, though sometimes they will create products, but they create broad tangible advancements, that can then be applied to many different spheres of life, in different economic sectors, that will, in the long run, be more beneficial.\\nThe fact that, these universities uniquely have the ability to draw in donors, in a way that public institutions do not, especially because they are a large place, for wealthy individuals to conglomerate, and therefore a place where wealth will often flow into at a rate that public universities simply will not have.\\nWe think that, on balance, private universities bring more good than harm.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ban strip clubs.\\nThree main areas of clash, first on why it is bad for societal norms.\\nWe want to break this down across the two sexes.\\nFirst we want to talk about women because we think that strip clubs really propagate a lot of really bad stereotypes about the way that women ought present themselves and what purpose women have.\\nWe think the problem is that even if society tries to pretend that women can do other things like they tell women that you can be more than just your body you can do things like pursue intellectual pursuits as long as things like strip clubs exist and the media reinforces their existence it is always going to be the case that there's a contradicting message sent by the general populace and sent by men.\\nOne that says that reaffirms all of the existing norms of objectification that tells women that regardless of what else they accomplish their basic use is going to be their for their body their point is going to be attractive and we feel like the problem with that then is that it like propagates the system that we already existed that prioritizes male desires and male pleasures and male like male pursuits above anything that has to do with women.\\nThis is literally an entire franchise created around the idea that men are going to satiate the deepest desires that women are going to satiate the deepest desires of men who come there.\\nWe also think the problem is like it propagates incredibly problematic norms of attractiveness.\\nWhen large proportion of the population go to strip clubs and like that's one of their earlier exposures to sex and to women and like that's one of the things that even when you're a child you hear about then in the way in which those strippers look becomes part of how you think the opposite gender ought look if you are a man.\\nIt's really difficult to be a stripper if you're above like a skinny a very skinny weight like we think of the idea they propagate is the only way in which you can be sexy or attractive is if you look in a particular manner or fit a certain image.\\nWe also think there there's like a harm to men as well.\\nIt narrows the way that they can see how women ought look or perform for them.\\nIt desensitizes men to real bodies and desires the majority of women don't look like that and don't want to be sex objects but if your main exposure to like sexuality and to the way that these things work is through strip clubs that's not something that you are likely to understand.\\nOur second area of clash is about how it encourages other really bad behavior.\\nLegal strip clubs attract illegal activities and that they often become hubs of drugs, prostitution, and trafficking but it's really hard to to regulate when all of these things have a legal front attached to them ie was that quiet backroom one for personal dances or was it a back room where women were being exploited and like sex trafficking was happening.\\nWe think that it becomes infinitely easier to expose these kinds of things and keep them actually like prevented when you ban strip clubs as a whole so that way there isn't an excuse for why that backroom exists and things like that.\\nOur third area of clash is about how it's fundamentally exploitative.\\nRecognize that the majority of strip clubs are run by men and they capitalize on women who are desperate but so that they can mistreat them ie if I am someone who cannot find a job somewhere else and recognize that even if we like to pretend that stripping can be empowering it is oftentimes the case of the people who end up at strip clubs aren't people who had their first decision to be there rather it is people who needed the money or who ended up there because they didn't have other alternatives.\\nWhat happens then is that because they are in a like in a position that is often disrespected by society they are often paid very little, there's no sexual harassment regulation because people see it as something that they deserve like these are honestly people who end up in this industry because they don't like not because they want to be there but because they get stuck there and then the industry uses them up and throws them back out.\\nThere's very little job stability, there's very little support if you are someone with a child then that's not something that your job will ever take into account we think that insofar this is something that is only ever going to harm people it ought not exist.\\nBan it.</td>\n",

miracle, in the way in which it allows expanded access to information, and expanded ways in which you can communicate with each other, and how quickly you can communicate with each other in easily, but in addition to those being fundamentally good, the internet is also incredibly good from a financial perspective.\\nIt makes just about everything cheaper, and easier, to do in your lives, and it creates an entire sector of an economy in advanced technologies.\\nSo, let's talk about these things.\\nFirst, let's talk about information.\\nI think that, it's obvious that the internet brings incredible opportunities for information.\\nFirst and foremost, the ease of access of that information, rather than having to possibly go to various distant locations, trying to track down text, in order to find what you're looking for.\\nThe internet allows you to have a centralized data base, that you can use to try to access information.\\nSo, whether it's whether you're trying to like research a policy, or learn about historical event, or a movement, or anything of the sort, it's going to be that much easier, because you're now going to have almost infinite information you can find, like academic research about things, journalistic articles about things, what people are saying, blogs, those are all different ways in which you can find out information.\\nSo, I think that that makes you a lot smarter, and it makes you a lot more educated, because it's a lot easier to access answers.\\nAnd, that's also good from a socio economic perspective, because rather than having to pay for a lot of these resources, paying for a lot of these books, and things like that, a lot of these things are free, and it allows information be more easily accessed by a lot more people in society.\\nBut, there is additionally the benefits of communication.\\nYou're able to keep in touch with people better that may live somewhere far away, you're better able to communicate your ideas with people, you're better able to organize like social movements, and political movements, because you're better able to communicate ideas across like large groups of people, it lets you more easily interact with people from far away places and other cultures, because the internet makes the illusions of it makes distance much more of an illusion.\\nI think it also just let's communication happen a whole lot more quickly, which is great in terms of being able to just like get your points across quickly, actually keeping like a better sense of closeness and contact with people.\\nBut, finally I think that, a lot of these things also have an incredibly good impact on businesses.\\nSo, being more able to access information, or being able to better like spread your ideas, maybe in academic community, those are just like examples of ways, in which the internet can help economies grow, because the spread of ideas, and the spread of information greater access of all these things, are some of the bigger driving forces in the economy.\\nBut additionally, the internet also creates its own business, because it creates an entire sector of an economy that, people work in.\\nSo you have like programmers, you have people who like sell computer products, develop hardware, develop software, marketing, like there's all kinds of things that people do for the internet, innovators.\\nAnd, this is incredibly important, because the internet revolves around a way of innovating new products to improve people's lives, there's a whole lot of like jobs in there, w whole lot of economic benefits, and profits that are being made from the internet.\\nSo, a lot of these things also result in just cheaper goods overall, things that make people's lives easier, or cheaper, and those are all incredibly important things to recognize, incredibly important benefits.\\nBut, finally, I don't really think that the harms of the internet are all that unique to the internet.\\nA lot of these things can be checked, by maybe like regulating like the quality of content online, if you're worried about like fake news or something like that, or cyber bullying, or trolling, or things like that.\\nA lot of the harms of the internet can be checked, as long as you properly regulate it and responsibly make sure that , things aren't going poorly.\\nSo, for all of those reasons, I definitely think that the internet does more good than harm.  \n",

                                                         We should continue fluoridating public water.\\nThree arguments for this.\\nThe first is about why putting fluoride in the water is a public good.\\nSo recognize that tooth decay is a very serious problem in almost every country in the world because there's nothing that can be done to remedy it.\\nPeople have one set of teeth for their adult life and unfortunately the high sugar, high acidity diets that most of us consume in today's world are pretty bad for your teeth.\\nSo it's essential that something is done to ensure that people don't have dental problems later in life.\\nWater fluoridation is so cheap it's almost free.\\nThere are no proven side effects, despite billions of dollars spent in europe and america researching this, so I'm just going to throw out what will said earlier about the fact that some papers exist means this is unlikely to be safe.\\nThe FDA and comparable groups in europe have done lots and lots of tests and found that water fluoridation is actually a net health good, that there's no real risk to it.\\nSo we think that ultimately this is safe and that it has clear proven benefits to preserving your teeth later in life.\\nAt that point in the same way that we're okay with putting up guardrails on highways even though they might have some marginal cost, because they clearly save people's lives we do this thing.\\nLook, maybe water fluoridation doesn't save anyone's life, but it obviously improves their quality of life in the long term.\\nNot everyone can afford to have a dentist fluoridate their teeth, not everyone is going to be able to purchase these packets, but everyone drinks the tap water so we think that ultimately it's important that everyone has access to fluoride in order to preserve their own teeth for later in life.\\nOur second argument is about why we think that it's okay for the government to paternalize and to put fluoride into the water.\\nTwo reasons.\\nThe first is that there's a compelling state interest.\\nIn most countries, although not my own, the government pays for people's dental health.\\nSo in places like britain maybe you have a co pay but ultimately if you're low income or going through a difficult time in terms of your job, the state will help you to pay for dentistry.\\nWhat that means is that there's a clear state interest in minimizing the cost of people's visits to the dentist.\\nBecause fluoridation reduces the rate of cavities which are going to be the most expensive thing to have people get taken care of at the dentist, we tell you that ultimately there's a compelling state interest to put fluoride in the water.\\nA couple of cents up front can save thousands of dollars later on root canals and other dental surgeries.\\nWe think that this compelling state interest is enough of a reason to paternalize.\\nEspecially because money for health is fungible.\\nAny money that's spent on giving, you know, somebody who has a cavity a new set of teeth, could have been spent on helping a child with some sort of congenital illness.\\nUltimately we think it's important that we use our money as effectively as possible, that the state is frugal, and fluoridation is certainly that.\\nAnd the second reason we think you can paternalize is because of the third party harms of not doing so.\\nIt may be true that adults can make a choice about whether or not to put fluoride in their water, but children really can't.\\nThey can only drink the water that they're given.\\nAt that point we think that children who can't choose to consent into this would be doing a lot of damage to their teeth and not rectifying it by using fluoride and ultimately they would suffer in the long term.\\nWe think the state needs to intervene to protect them.\\nThe third reason we think that we should put fluoride in the water is that it's not an undue burden on anyone.\\nWill tries to tell you that it's unrealistic to ask people who don't want fluoride to drink bottled water.\\nBut I think it's an undue burden to ask everybody who wants healthy teeth to go out and buy fluoride so that a couple of hippies don't have to have fluoride in their water.\\nThis cuts both ways.\\nWe think that at the end of the day, bottled water, in the US at least, is so cheap it's almost free if you buy it in bulk.\\nAt that point we don't think it's an undue burden that the tiny minority of people who don't want fluoride have to spend a few dollars every week on water.\\nSo at the end of the day we think it's clear that the state should continue to fluoridate water.\\nThank you.  \n",
       "1333  Teacher tenure reform brings more harm than good.\\nWhen we're talking about teacher tenure reform, we think we're talking about things like eliminating the length at which tenure kicks in, so making it from, say, five years at which you can receive tenure, to ten years, and shortening the amount of time that you can keep tenure for, from the rest of your life to, say, ten, five years, et cetera.\\nSo these are the reforms that we think are problematic.\\nWhy do we think that this is a an especially problematic problem?\\nWe think that in the status quo, teachers in western liberal democracies are often massively undervalued for their labour, especially in places like the united states, and in public schools especially, teachers are dramatically underpaid compared to other educational sectors such as private schools, but more importantly, teachers are underpaid compared to many other possible job opportunities that individuals can take.\\nSo why do we can the tenure is so crucial in ensuring that good teachers are in our public school systems and are allowing our children to learn in the most efficacious way possible?\\nSo first thing is teacher recruitment.\\nIn the status quo, teachers face low wages, they're often undervalued by society, especially by parents that have to interact with them that blame the teachers for the problems that their children have, and more importantly, you can bet unions all across the western world, especially teacher unions, are being attacked on a massive scale, which means that their ability to organize, their ability to get better benefits, their ability to increase their wages, and their ability to get protections that are necessary are now being limited because of the attack on unions that our current because of blame that people place on unions for increased taxes, etcetera etcetera.\\nThis given that this is the case, we think that when someone enters college and someone needs to get a degree in order to become a teacher, when they're thinking about whether or not that degree is worthwhile, we think that many people simply don't see teaching as a profession that in the long run is going to be able to pay off, is going to provide enough money to make their college education worth it, and to make it so that they can live a comfortable life.\\nTenure is an incentive that people can have that drives them into education.\\nTenure allows for job security that simply does not exist in almost any other part of our society, in any other work force in our society.\\nGiven that this is the case, we think that tenure can be an immense tool for motivating people to get into education, and we don't think that education is something that people simply never want to do, but we think that when people have to make real trade offs between whether or not they're going to get a higher or lower wage, this is something can meaningfully motivate them towards choosing teaching over, say, economics or business.\\nSecondly, teacher retention.\\nBecause recognize, not every teacher gets tenure.\\nOnly the best teachers get tenure.\\nOnly the teachers that prove they can educate in a good way, and that they can keep students engaged in the classroom, are able to get tenure.\\nGiven that this is the case, we think that these are the teachers that are most likely going to get poached by other private schools or private industry.\\nAnd again, the ability to have job security is something that is beneficial for teachers in the status quo, and is something that allows teachers to be retained, because you don't only want teachers to come in and work hard for a brief period of time, but you want teachers to breed a culture in an educational system that is one that strives for students to learn, that gets them excited about learning, and I think the way that you do this this for continuity of teachers and through ensuring that you can retain the best teachers that you have in your system.\\nWithout having tenure, it makes it impossible to lock teachers up for a long period of time, and it makes it so that other sorts of job opportunities that present to that are presented to them, say working in a private school rather than working in a public school, that pays higher wages and gets better benefits, we think that when those things are opportunities that teachers have, you can't simply give away tenure that these teachers have just because some teachers abuse it, just because some teachers get through the cracks and get tenure when they don't deserve this.\\nWe think the vast majority of teachers that receive tenure our worthy teachers that are working hard and we think that if you reform the tenure system and you make it less strong, you're simply not going to get as many qualified teachers applying or working in these schools it harms our student and harms everyone's future.\\nFor those reasons, we don't think that teacher we think that teacher tenure brings more harm than it brings good.  \n",

that schools have and they are: a, teaching, as in exposing children to knowledge and helping them develop important skills on several different fields that will help them in the future, and b, socializing, as in allowing these children to fruitfully interact and , like, collect social experiences by which they will be better prepared for life in society.\\nTwo arguments today.\\nFirst, why do mixed schools harm the ability of the schools to actually teach and two, why did single sex schools don't harm the social skills of the children.\\nBefore we begin, just to clarify, we are talking about the ages of middle school and high school and obviously we assume that the level of teaching and the level of like facilities and services is going to be identical for both genders.\\nFirst argument: what was once true to only children in high school is becoming in the in the last couple of generations more and more true in younger and younger ages and that is that girls and boys suddenly discover each other.\\nHormones begin to run wild, friendships begin to form and the classrooms are filled with teen spirit.\\nAt this point it is only natural for children to be incredibly preoccupied with their social situation.\\nHow do they look like?\\nWho took up an interest in them?\\nEtcetera.\\nWe say that at this stage entering thirty teenagers, girls and boys, into the same room for several hours each day and expect that they would be actually able to sit down concentrate and study math is just sheer lunacy.\\nEven if some of them were interested in actually studying we say that these children were not couldn't afford it because they will immediately be branded as uncool and lose the favor of the other sex.\\nAnd even if there are still two or three children that are just trying to still focus we say that this gets almost impossible when the rest of the class is so busy doing other things and the teacher spends half the time trying to shut everybody up.\\nNow this is of course a slight exaggeration but the point is that once we separate girls and boys children will spend far less time at in like gazing at someone they have a crush on or worrying how they look like or what other people might think of them and then they get more like open or they get more focused and they can sit down and study.\\nWe say that when schools want to put like forty children in one classroom then immediately we see a response coming from the parents and from everyone in society that this isn't right.\\nAnd we say that this is a justified response because this is a surrounding unfit for studying.\\nWell same goes here.\\nSecond argument: opposition is going to try and tell you that these distractions are an inseparable part of growing up and that single sex schools are going to like prevent the children from experiencing important interactions with the other sex.\\nWe agree that these interactions are an important part of like maturity, but it is unclear to us why can't these interactions and friendships be formed outside of school.\\nWe say that when we said that that the school system has two roles, they are not equally important because the school's main job is to actually be able to teach children and the rest like the socializing part is just a byproduct that comes with it.\\nIt is important but school isn't necessarily needed in order to form this.\\nChildren today are hanging out more and more in inter school gangs.\\nWe have after school activities we have the neighborhood public areas and again girls and boys are going to just be so busy thinking about one another that we are sure that they will manage with finding one another so let's at least keep the classroom sterile place and where they can actually sit down and study something.\\nWe beg you to propose.  \n",

fools and idiots actually support it.\\nOr people who are just evil.\\nOr crazy.\\nSo let's talk about why, because first, I think that abstinence only sex education is immoral, and second I think it's grossly ineffective and wildly obscene.\\nSo first, let's talk about why sex abstinence only sex education is just immoral.\\nLet's not sugarcoat what abstinence only sex education is, it's trying to force archaic christian religious values onto an oftentimes unwilling more modern and progressive populace.\\nWhat this looks like, is oftentimes using scare tactics, like I don't know, you're going to you know get like pregnant and die if you have sex, or you'll get this big spooky disease, inherently by having sex.\\nIt glosses over the nuances of what this actually entails.\\nIt's trying to scare people into living in a certain kind of a lifestyle, and I think this is quite bad, because honestly there's nothing wrong with sex, there's nothing wrong with having sex, we shouldn't shame people for having sex, or wanting to have sex.\\nIt's just like a very like natural thing that humans want to do, it's fun, it's enjoyable, there's nothing wrong with it, there's no reason why we should shame it, and there's no reason why we shouldn't emphasize a focus on it.\\nThis is, like, there like being ready for sex is like being ready for like driving a car.\\nIt's just like a part of getting older, it's something that happens, you don't have to wait until marriage, whether that happens in like in like your thirties or something like that, like it's absolutely ridiculous, and it's archaic, and it's and it's ridiculous that we have institutions that try to force this lifestyle onto people.\\nBut, second, and even more perniciously, is just how ineffective an unsafe abstinence only sex education is.\\nThere is a reason why the rates of unwanted pregnancies, and the rates of STI and STD like like STD affliction are a whole lot higher in abstinence only education states, in like the deep south in america, than they are in more progressive and sane places like massachusetts.\\nAnd the reason for this is because shockingly, people do not buy into absence only sex education.\\nBecause it is such an inherent part of like human life, people tend to have sex anyway.\\nSo since this is just true, how are you going to best make sure that people actually do this in a safe and responsible and educated way?\\nWell, a good way to start doing that is by educating people.\\nWhen you do not actually educate them on like, how to like use condoms or access condoms, what are different kinds of birth controls that you can access, what are like the best ways to prevent like access to like STD's and things like that, all of these things are very important, because you feel more educated.\\nBut additionally, sense you're fostering when you have abstinence only sex education, like what I talked about earlier, you're fostering in a culture that almost shame sex.\\nSo you're going to be less willing to seek out help, you're going to be less willing to seek out contraceptives, you're going to be less willing to seek out an abortion, all of these things are less likely to happen, because you feel like society is going to shun you, or society is going to condemn you, and all of that is happening simply because you have sex.\\nThis is absolutely horrible.\\nThis results in a lot of the like destruction of lives for youth.\\nThere are more people who have unwanted pregnancies, and don't feel comfortable getting out of it, or don't know how to get out of it, because of like the way in which they grew up, and that's just not something that we should have.\\nIt leads to like more of affliction of diseases, more wide spreading of diseases, because people don't know the best ways to combat that, all of these things are just inherently worse, and none of these things are intrinsic to sex.\\nThere's ways to have sex without pregnancy, there's ways to have sex without spreading of diseases, billions of people do it all the time.\\nAnd we should focus on that.\\nSo for all those reasons, abstinence only sex education is absolutely horrible, it definitely brings more harm than good.  \n",

drive-throughs, restaurant chains like mcdonald's and burger king, any restaurant that claims to be a fast food restaurant and advocates for things like drive-throughs and very fatty meals in very small packages, we would like to ban.\\nTwo main areas of clash, the first on obesity as an epidemic.\\nRecognize that this current generation is the first that is expected to have a shorter life expectancy than the previous generation.\\nThis is mostly due to the diets that we have the the previous generation did not have to deal with.\\nSo diets that are very high in saturated fats, or unsaturated fats and trans fats, and like diets that have a lot of sugars and a lot of carbs and specifically diets that package these large amounts of bad ingredients into very small packages that make us feel like we're eating a smaller amount of food than we actually are.\\nThis requires paternalism because you can't internalize the long term harms.\\nSo I'm sitting here eating a cheeseburger and I think that all this means is that I'll exercise an extra hour tonight, but the reality is that these preservatives inside it are building up inside the tissues of my body and in the long term it's doing things like causing heart disease and cancer.\\nMore than this though, in the short term it's a lot harder to exercise off fast food than less processed food or food coming from better restaurants or from the grocery store.\\nThis is because your packaging it's basically what I said earlier you are taking large amounts of calories and large amounts of fats and putting it into a very small package that makes you feel you're consuming less of it.\\nSo we think that the alternative world in which you don't ban fast food is essentially the one that we're beginning to see in the status quo.\\nHeart disease and heart attacks continue to go up, diabetes, people are dying younger, and you're seeing larger and larger rates of obesity, especially in young children and like school age children that that prevents them from being able to be fully mobile and enjoy like being active.\\nOur secondary of clash has to do with the dangerous way in which fast food restaurants target populations because people who can afford it usually don't eat very much fast food.\\nThey tend to buy their own groceries and like eat at better restaurants because in the end, fast food doesn't taste the best.\\nIt's just a means of getting food into your body.\\nThis means that fast food restaurants specifically place themselves into poorer areas because they know that these are the people who are going to not be able to afford something that is better.\\nThe problem with this is that there are chains that are willing to stay within poorer areas that aren't necessarily only fast food.\\nSo we see initiatives that specifically put fresh food like produce grocery stores in poorer in food deserts and you see bowman pop shops that pop up that like want to feed the residents of that area but all of these things get crowded out because they can't compete with how cheap fast food restaurants are.\\nSo we think that when you ban fast food you allow for these healthier alternatives to remain in these areas because the demand for food, and the demand to eat out is always going to exist.\\nThe question is how much are people going to be willing to pay for it and when you and we think that when you have no cheaper alternative, then you're going to have people eating healthier by requirement.\\nMore than this though, we think that this is the equivalent of economic discrimination.\\nHow much you earn shouldn't dictate your food options which then translate into your long term health options.\\nJust because I might have grown up in a poorer neighborhood than my friend, shouldn't mean that I am guaranteed to get diabetes earlier or die sooner.\\nSo we think that when fast foods are essentially propagating this kind of discrimination, it ought be banned in order to protect people.\\nFor these reasons proud to propose.  \n",

just rights-violative.\\nIt's inherently a violation of the rights of elderly people and secondarily, because it's bad for the economy.\\nIt's not even an economically good decision to do this.\\nSo, let's first start by talking about rights.\\nI think that the right to work is generally a pretty powerful norm of a lot of countries have legislation on having a right to choose what occupations you want to work in.\\nCertainly in the united states and a lot of there's a lot of constitutional protections even about right to work in various fields, right to make a living.\\nBut I think that additionally, it's also clearly facilitative.\\nYou need to be able to work in order to make money and you need that to do just about everything, from travel to be healthy, to eat, to have shelter, all of these things are required for that.\\nSo, why, therefore, is it bad to have forced retirement?\\nBecause I think that you're essentially applying a a broad standard on to everyone, in incredibly unequal cases.\\nBecause I think that the main idea behind such a ban is that there is a deterioration of people's health, maybe it's cognitive skills, physical skills, but the problem is that aging happens in very inexact ways, in very variant ways.\\nSo you could have some people who may need to retire much earlier than others, some people who get alzheimer's at an earlier age, maybe in their sixties, other people who are sharp as ever into their late nineties though, other people maybe if they're like in like very good shape, if they're an athletic.\\nThese are also reasons why different people can have different health.\\nAnd that's important because you're taking away the ability, the freedom of someone to make money, make a living, earn more, possibly for themselves, so they can spend more time when they so they have more disposable income when they do retire or to give to their descendants.\\nThis is something that can be important to them, and people want to work, they should be able to work.\\nBut I think that additionally this also contributes to further stereotyping of the elderly.\\nWhen you get to like a forced retirement age, people are more likely to look at elderly people as incapable and incompetent, and I think that's generally just going to lead to more elderly people feeling isolated and excluded as they get older.\\nBut the next argument that I want to talk about is the economic factor of this, because I don't think that this is very good for the economy as well.\\nAnd this is quite simply because obviously, when you're not working anymore, you're not actively producing, you're not actively contributing your productivity the economy anymore, and that's pretty bad.\\nBut I think additionally, not just you're withdrawing productivity but you're also adding on a resource strain because the moment in which you retire, your you become eligible for things like in america, at least, medicaid, medicare and social security, other kinds of benefits for the elderly, pension benefits, things like that.\\nAnd this is very important because those are all they just cost more money.\\nYou should and the longer someone lives, if you possibly set a mandatory retirement age at too early an age, when other people are healthy, all of these benefits accrue in cost and they're pretty expensive for a society to front money for.\\nSo, it's not you can spend that money on just about anything else, from like education, infrastructure, maybe like cut taxes even, if you want you to, or help poor people more.\\nLike there's all of different kinds of things that you can do with the money that you would save by letting people work instead into their later years, instead of having to paternalize them in this way.\\nSo it's for all those reasons, very proud to oppose.  \n",

agriculture in the status quo in the developed world.\\nWe think that oftentimes people, when they think of agriculture, they have a a vision of bar small family farms in which few people are in charge of the farm, or in which there is small amounts of land being taken care of, but that's simply not the case in the status quo.\\nIn the status quo farming is largely a large corporate business in which thousands of thousands of farms are owned by conglomerates and controlled in such a way in which large corporate profits are boosted and very few people still own their farms.\\nFor this reason we can that's actually crucial that we subsidize agriculture.\\nWe think that's important to ensure that small farms are able to be maintained and more importantly that we subsidize agricultural systems that are efficacious both for our health and for the things that we're supposed to be taking care of, AKA the world.\\nSo, why do you think that subsidies help in this regard?\\nWe think that targeted subsidies to the few existing family farms and to the few existing small farms ensure that ethical farming practices are able to take place.\\nWhether this in the instances of agriculture what we think this amounts to is ensuring that pesticides and insecticides aren't overly used on crops that exist, because these are types of things that can have major detrimental impacts on the health of individuals and largely do occur on those large macro farms in which large amounts of land and large amounts products need to be taken care of and in order to do so industrial pesticides and things of that nature are overwhelmingly used in those instances.\\nBut on smaller farms where crops are more manageable these types of practices aren't necessary in the same sense.\\nSo when you're able to subsidize these farms we think that the amount of good products, of well grown fruit and vegetables that aren't covered in insecticides and pesticides, that aren't harmed by these things, that are more healthy for humans to consume, we think the amount of those are larger but it also ensures that in order to get those good products individuals don't need to pay exorbitant prices they don't have to, because these farms don't need to compete with the same type of prices ur they still need to compete with the same type of prices of these macro farms, these large corporate farms but because they're being subsidized the consumer doesn't have to pay for that but rather the government can pay for that can ensure that good products are able to be produced.\\nMore importantly, we can that when you give subsidies it allows for more innovation from these types of farms and we think that types of farm such a thing farms that are practicing with things like vertical farming are able to be more explored when they're subsidized.\\nThe reason for this is that new innovations in things like agriculture are hard to come by because the macro farms don't need innovation in order to make a profit but the smaller farms do.\\nAnd when you allow the smaller farms to flourish through subsidies they can do things that are more risky, such as testing out new farming methods.\\nVertical farming for instance is farming that ensures that allows for a more efficacious use of land because you grow upwards rather than just using the amount of square footage that you have on the ground.\\nThis type of farming requires new techniques and other and other types techniques are necessary to ensure that good products and good fruits and vegetables can still be produced without having to use vast amounts of insecticides, pesticides and other types of fertilizing and farming techniques that are harmful to the environment and that are harmful to the the ecosystem in which we live.\\nWe think that subsidizing these types of products, that allow for a more holistic approach to farming, that allow for a less harmful impact on the environment in which we farm, and in which small farms are able to compete with larger corporate farms is a better is a better environment in which we should have our society, it's a better environment in which our children grow up in and we think that it's a healthier environment overall and a healthier farming system and agriculture system for all of us that consume the goods that the agriculture system puts out.\\nWe don't think that subsidies need to be given in large parts to these corporations, that are doing fine, but in these other instances we think that subsidies are absolutely crucial and we think that for for that reason we should certainly subsidized agriculture.  \n",

fluoridation brings more harm than good.\\nWhat's something I think that it's important to recognize that the very top of this debate, is something that may not seem apparent to many people, which is that well water fluoridation may seem ubiquitous, in many european countries in the united states, it is in fact not that common throughout the world.\\nThat most states do not do water fluoridation commonly for their public water supply, and many developed states such as japan also don't use fluoride in their water in any meaningful way.\\nSo we think this is important for focusing the mindset of the debate which is that, water fluoridation is not a necessary part of a healthy life.\\nIt's not entirely necessary to get fluoride for the human body, and in the ways in which we get fluoride, it's most important to get it topically and it's provided in the wide in most societies and in the societies that have water fluoridation, primarily through things like using toothpaste and through other advances in medical treatment and such that ensure that most people do achieve the right amount of fluoride that they should have in the status quo regardless of water fluoridation.\\nSo, with that in mind, we think that water fluoridation brings more harm than good for a few reasons.\\nFirstly, over-fluoridation.\\nIt is important to recognize that fluoride is just a chemical that you can put into your body, and that, too much of a dosage of that chemical can lead to harms in the body.\\nWe think that this is important to recognize for a few reasons.\\nFirstly, the children and babies are as they're growing more susceptible to this, and because dosage can't be controlled when public fluoridation happens, we think what's we think that what is likely to and what does occur is that children and infants receive too much fluoride which can has been shown to hurt brain development in some instances, and because of this we think it's important to recognize that water fluoridation is something that can't be monitored in the same way that dosages of fluoride or dosages of any sort of treatment might be able to be monitored, which means that over fluoridation is a harm that happens rather broadly throughout society in places in which water fluoridation occurs.\\nThis is an old practice, it is an outdated practice that doesn't that isn't required and is not a necessity in our modern times due to advances in medical treatment and because of this we think that these the trade off between not being able to control the doses for people, in which this can have actual harms, where adults may not experience these harms, we certainly think that that's a trade off that we're not willing to make.\\nFurthermore, we think that this steals the people's right to autonomy and to their consent especially in the sense of their bodily autonomy.\\nFirstly as a democratic polity, we think that what's bad about water fluoridation in the status quo is that people aren't generally informed about the possibilities of water fluoridation.\\nFirstly, it's rather untested compared to other scientific approaches to medical treatment and this ensures that even if good access, even if good information existed on this, people wouldn't be , that good information does not exist on this and therefore even if it people would not, are not able to access it.\\nBut furthermore, people simply do not access, do not seek out this information because it's not a major issue that people consider in the political sphere.\\nBut this is important because it and it means that without the direct consent of the people, without their informed consent people are having their bodily makeup, their composition, and how they're medically treated, is being determined by the state without them having the full understanding of what's happening to them, and without being able to fully consent to that.\\nWe think that, given that this exists, given that there are not major medical advances that happen to people, that this isn't an overwhelming medical good that's occurring, we think that the lack of consent is an important flaw of water fluoridation.\\nWe think that without this consent, the government doesn't have the right to do any sort of thing to the political body especially something that imposes a breach of an individual's bodily autonomy.\\nAnd because of this, we think that water fluoridation oversteps the boundaries of what the government is able to do and in this sense, and the practical pragmatic harms that it brings to people, we think that water fluoridation brings more harm than good.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                            We believe that urbanization is actually incredibly positive.\\nTwo main areas of clash, the first on why it is better for the environment than spread out or more rural areas contrary to what will seems to believe.\\nFirst recognize that the kind of transport that occurs in the city is much more environmentally friendly than the requirement to own a car in every single rural or suburban area.\\nBecause it is much more environmentally efficient to to load hundreds of people onto one train car and send only that train car rather than to displace those same hundreds of people into individual, privately owned cars.\\nI also think it's important to note that cars are considered the second largest emitter in the world and so this is actually a very big deal environmentally to preserve based on public transport.\\nWe think that it's really easy to label cities as these massive pollutants, and they are, but the reason that people think that they are so much more polluting than urban or within a rural or suburban areas is because of the fact they actually show their concentrations of smog.\\nBecause recognize that the same kind of damage is produced by rural and suburban areas but you don't see it in the same way like in terms of the clouds hanging over the cities and so you don't internalize the damage.\\nWe actually think it's really positive for people to be able to see the damage that they make because it creates a much more effective wakeup call when this smog is actually harming me personally, I am much more likely to do something about it, I am much more likely to rage at my government to do something about it.\\nAnd we think we have we've seen this crystallize insofar as urban areas actually end up getting the newest environmental technology much faster than it goes out to rural or suburban areas and you're much more likely to get regulations on corporations in urban areas than in rural areas because they affect more people and thus get much more attention pushed towards them.\\nYou also end up with better filters because you can cover smaller areas but still more people so it ends up being more economically solvent for governments and for corporations to spend money on making urban areas healthier than rural areas healthier because whenever you go to rural or suburban areas you're dealing with much larger land mass and so it's much more expensive to make it more environmentally friendly.\\nOur secondary of clash has to do with why it's better for people and society.\\nFirst, cities oftentimes end up being one of the largest melting pots in the united states because you end up with large amounts of immigrants and large amounts of people from different cultures living in very small spaces and interacting with each other on a daily basis.\\nThere's a reason that cities tend to be much more liberal than rural and suburban areas, this is because when you have continuous contact with people from different cultures you are much more likely to empathize with them and it makes it much more difficult to hate them.\\nThis leads to net better politics so you end up with you like you've never heard of the sanctuary rural mississippi but you do end up with large cities that are willing to take up the status of sanctuary cities because they see the protection of immigrants as a worthy cause.\\nSo cities are more much more likely to vote for policies that are actually going to benefit immigrants whereas rural and suburban areas are much more likely to elect racist politicians.\\nLike poor white people living in rural areas massively left of trump.\\nIt's also the case that cities end up with more innovation because of the concentration of abilities.\\nLike one of the biggest areas with like the silicon valley is a city that has some of the largest amounts of start ups like in the world specifically because when you get so many brilliant people in the same area you can do much more good work than if those people live miles and miles apart and have difficulty communicating which with each other.\\nThis is also much better for the economy because you're ending up with with much more smaller businesses much more startups and thus more trade between individuals and better economic boosts.\\nThere's also often better put better infrastructure for poverty in populated urban cities because they have to face this poverty head on.\\nFor these reasons proud to oppose.  \n",

the needle exchange programs.\\nSo in this debate we're gonna make two main arguments: the first is about public health and the second is the principle behind drug use and drug criminalization and why we think it's problematic and ultimately is not a reason to abolish the needle exchange program.\\nOkay, so firstly on public health.\\nWe would say that no matter what a person does as far as drugs they choose to use, or what they do with their body, or how they interact with the world around them, that person is still first and foremost a citizen of the state in which they're governed and because they are part of that state we think the state has overriding obligations to them, as a human being and as a citizen, that must be upheld.\\nAnd we think that one of those obligations is to their health and their well being.\\nSo even if someone does something like uses drugs, we don't think that this means that they are now excluded from the social contract that governs interactions between people and the state, we don't think that that means that they should be condemned to the health disasters that can come without the needle exchange program.\\nSo let's walk through what some of these are and why to abolish this program would be incredibly problematic for public health.\\nSo firstly the reason the needle exchange program exists is because when people don't have these types of programs they resort, they don't, you know, stop using drugs all of a sudden because they don't have clean needles, they just continue to use the same needles that they've been using or they you take needles from other people and these needles end up oftentimes having diseases attached to them.\\nSo one common disease as the transfer of HIV is very common between people that are using drugs and use needles and share needles between each other.\\nNow, these diseases that spread through needle use are incredibly like problematic.\\nThese aren't just simple diseases, short term illnesses, these are diseases that can have long term and major health ramifications in a person's life and could ultimately lead to death if not if not treated properly, and drug users of those that are probably most likely to not get the treatment that they need in order to stay healthy to begin with.\\nAnd these these diseases don't just impact the drug users themselves.\\nFirstly when they end up going to the hospital, when they end up going to get their health, when they end up going somewhere to try and get treatment, that bill is almost always passed on to the public.\\nAnd the reason for this is because drug users, especially people that are getting HIV from their heroine needles, these are people that oftentimes don't have health insurance but the hospitals can't refuse to treat them in these life threatening situations, and therefore that bill gets passed on to the state.\\nThe other thing that's important to recognize is that if someone uses a uses a needle that is unclean, and they get HIV from it, they can spread this disease to other people in their interactions.\\nInnocent people that chose to have sexual relations with these drug users, people that clearly have no harm, have brought no harm upon themselves, that have done nothing to warrant that type of harm I'm now going to be harmed because we take away these programs.\\nAll these people are a part of the social contract.\\nAll these people are citizens of the state the state should keep public health is a primary concern because of the massive ramifications, especially in regards to needle exchange programs.\\nSo the second thing we wanna talk about briefly is that we would say that all the arguments that are made about these people are heroin users, or these people are drug users, they're breaking the law and therefore they don't deserve to have this type of treatment, they don't deserve to have this, this leads them to use drugs more often, firstly the fact that you can get a clean needle is not a motivating factor to do heroin for any normal person.\\nNormal people don't just suddenly decide: \" oh well, now that I can get the needle, that is the meaningful tipping point for me using heroin \".\\nWe just don't think that people behave that way, and furthermore we would say that those prohibition, most of these prohibitions are overwhelmingly targeted at marginalized communities in the status quo, and overwhelmingly harm those communities and unjust manner.\\nWe don't think that these types of justifications mean that people need to be condemned to some severe diseases such as HIV.\\nWe don't think that abolishing needle exchange programs will lower the rate of drug use, we think it'll only increase the rate of disease from drug use.\\nAnd for these reasons we should not abolish needle exchange programs.  \n",

current form, but because of any alternatives that could possibly exist would be inferior.\\nAny feasible alternatives would simply not be good enough, and social security is so important to so many people.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, that we keep and await it.\\nFirst let's start by talking about some of the things that we would defend.\\nWe think it's perfectly comfortable that since we're defending the side of keeping the social security tax as it currently is, we can still defend minor changes, for example, ending the contribution caps and things like that that make it a more financially salient solution to the baby boomer problem.\\nSo, now that this has been established, let's talk about why social security is so important to the lives of so many senior citizens.\\nRecognize that before the passage of social security by the FDR administration, millions upon millions of senior citizens died in poverty, with no money at all to their name.\\nWhy is this true?\\nBecause senior citizens do not as they are retired, obviously, don't have money to take care of themselves.\\nThey don't have a way to generate income and they don't have a way to just take care of themselves in very basic ways.\\nSo this puts them in a position of extreme dependency out of no fault of their own, simply out of biological necessity.\\nBut, additionally, the money that seniors make and the money that seniors save becomes less valuable over time as goods become more expensive and as inflation rises, so maybe and additionally, as minimum wage laws and things like that also generally progress.\\nSo this is important because it means that even if you made a good amount of money in your living, it's still difficult to save that money because you're going to have even if you save your money up, you're still not going to have enough money, likely, to afford the basic things that you need to enjoy a good quality of life once you become a senior citizen.\\nSo, now that we've established that social security is incredibly important, let's next talk about why it is necessary that we keep it in the form it is.\\nSo first, I think it's highly unlikely that we would ever actually see a more progressive system like the one that our government described, and I think the reason for this is because the political incentives against social security are oftentimes already incredibly large and that there is not that many more incentives to do those kinds of things.\\nI think that the much more likely scenario that we would see play out would be a privatization scheme.\\nSo, this would be absolutely horrible, and it would be absolutely horrible for several reasons.\\nFirst and foremost, I think that when you create a profit motive for this industry, rather than relying on the government to make investments and not having to worry about profit, when you have a profit seeking industry taking care of this, they're more likely to take higher risk investments, and they'll take those higher risk investments because they have a possible promise of a higher payout.\\nNow, this may sound okay because it means that senior citizens are going to get more money, but I ultimately think that this is a big problem because when you're taking a risk with someone else's money, you are additionally also likely to be less careful with this.\\nSo this is incredibly bad because I think that what this will likely therefore end up doing is whenever you get to a time of a recession or even in non-times of recession, you're going to have people taking risks with senior citizens' life savings, things that they depend on to survive, and that's simply not something that we can accept, so that's not going to work.\\nBut additionally, privatization is also going to be more expensive for people because even if you're not going to have to pay the social security tax or the like, you're still going to have to take things like manager fees, you have to pay usually like basis points off of like basis points off of the money that you make or investments that you make and things like that.\\nAnd oftentimes because of the higher costs of operating for the private sector and about how they have to make the profit, you're going to have to pay more for the exact same service that you're getting.\\nSo this is going to hurt poor people, and this is really bad because these poor people are the ones who rely on social security the most.\\nBut finally, I don't think that the using employer-funded systems are a very good solution because as we see in the status quo, employer funded pensions can oftentimes be ended or cut prematurely, which additionally leads to the harm that we are talking about to a whole lot of people.\\nSo for all of those reasons, we should definitely not cancel the social security tax.  \n",

                                                                                                                               We should not subsidize single parents.\\nSo to start, let's try to frame what the problem here is.\\nBy and large people who have children as like single parents can fall into like one or two categories: there's people who are by choice single parents, people who want to have a child but they're not dating anyone are married to anyone's they get donations, and on the second category of people, where it's not by choice.\\nWhere it's a result of an accidental pregnancy, maybe even like sexual assault or some other kind of like coercive situation, maybe like a religious like religious family, things like that that can coerce you into having a child even if you don't wanna have one.\\nSo the position that we're going to take is if you are having your child by choice and you're not able to support that child, if it's your choice then you're taking on the responsibilities of having another human being.\\nSo you need to be able to be responsible for that.\\nIf it's not by choice, rather than trying to deal with the consequences of all the financial consequences of an accidental pregnancy that results in single parenthood, we should instead more precisely focus our policies to actually attack the root of this problem.\\nOr in other words make it so that people aren't having like there's no single people aren't having children if they're not prepared for it as single parents in the first place.\\nSo what do we think that this would look like?\\nThis would be instead of taking the money that you used to subsidize single parents and instead using that to subsidize things like birth control, contraceptives, condoms, abortions if necessary.\\nBecause in a lot of this money could be used way more effectively.\\nObviously it takes a whole lot of money to raise a child if you're not ready for it, you have to, like whether it's like medical care, education expenses, food expenses, like clothing, like children are very very expensive.\\nThat much is obvious.\\nSo if you don't have a whole lot of money you're going to be heavily reliant on various forms of public assistance.\\nSo we can lessen dependence on that in more financially efficient ways by making it more likely that people just get abortions or people will have access to birth control that maybe they weren't able to access or afford before, and maybe just maybe we could even have mandatory sex education that would make it so that people are more likely to rely on those services in the first place.\\nI think that you would have a lot better of a situation because you would be saving a lot of money of course.\\nYou'd be saving money because it's just more economically efficient to to try to like prevent this problem in the first place.\\nBut it would also by and large be more moral and a lot of circumstances.\\nBecause a lot of people who have unwanted pregnancies or pregnancies were not prepared for pregnancies, are in like coercive situations.\\nThey're in financial financially coercive situations because maybe they can't afford an abortion, they live in some or maybe they live some part of the world, or somewhere in the united states even, where abortions are incredibly difficult to get or inaccessible, maybe birth control isn't accessible to them for various reasons.\\nSo by and large a lot of people who end up as single parents, they tend to be poor, they tend to be people and there's a reason for that.\\nBecause if you have less like financial, if you have less money you're not going to be able to spend that money to essentially terminate a pregnancy early if you need to.\\nSo I think that for all those reasons we should stop subsidizing single parents.  \n",

deal of self sacrifice having to leave the country he grew up in behind in order to really deeply help the people in that country.\\nSo let's start by talking about why what he blew the whistle on is absolutely abhorrent and is something the government should have never been doing in the first place and certainly non-secret and then second, why it was necessary for him to take the actions that he took and circumvent like traditional like avenues of like essentially whistle blow illegally.\\nSo let's start by talking about what exactly he did.\\nObviously he uncovered a huge mass of national security surveillance.\\nA large deal of which the public wasn't really aware of and I think that this is inherently bad because there's a reason why we have several amendments in the US constitution that explicitly protect people's privacy in different ways.\\nWhether it's like freedom against searches and seizure or other kinds of things.\\nIt's always been a right the right to privacy has always been one of the most important things in america and certainly a lot of our jurisprudence upholds this idea and the reason for that is just because people have the right to have like their own identity basically and control what people know about them, what people can possibly harass them based on and what people how people are going to live their lives and when the government has essentially like near infinite information on every single person in society, that creates like a huge problem and a lot of ways it's like a surveillance state type that is really really eerie and spooky in that the government would be able to monitor you at all times, know where you're going at all times, know everything that you're doing at all times, and these are things that certainly the government just should not know about you.\\nThe government shouldn't know where you are every minute of the day.\\nThe government shouldn't know who you're talking to every minute of the day because people should have the expectation of privacy, people being able to like keep communications like maybe between people who are close to them or business communications are all of these things private.\\nBut beyond just like the fact that the government shouldn't have this information in the first place, the fact that the government is collecting all this information one place is an absolutely horrible and stupid idea especially in relation to cybersecurity.\\nSo what would be easier?\\nLet's say that you want to get every single person in america so you want to get half of americans of a hundred forty million or so security numbers, what do you do if you want a hundred and forty million security numbers?\\nDo you hack equifax or do you hack a hundred and forty million people's individual computers and try to get those security numbers?\\nYou're probably going to do the first one because that just makes way more sense because you're you're only having to do the thing once.\\nYou're getting all that massive data at once that's more useful.\\nSo when the government just compiles all of this sensitive information people's like phone like like records from like internet like transaction like basically like anything that you do that leaves some kind of a digital footprint, the government tries to illicitly collect data on, creates something that's incredibly vulnerable to hackers because the government certainly can't keep itself safe from hackers.\\nThe CIA is getting hacked for christ sake.\\nBeyond that it's also a big problem that there was never sufficient public discussion about this.\\nThere was never really consent to this in that the people never really knew the extent to which the government was actually watching them and the fact that there was so much uproar afterwards, the fact that the CI that the fact that the NSC an the CIA and all these other agencies had pressure put on them to try to change some of the tactics they're doing to make it at least a little bit better, shows how upset people were at what was happening.\\nThat people didn't know that was happening in the first place.\\nThat brings us to the final thing which is why was necessary that edward snowden did this?\\nPoliticians didn't care, the people didn't know, and this was keep going to happen again and again for who knows how long.\\nEdward snowden took a stand and for those reasons we should protect him.  \n",

                                                                       ADHD management brings more harm than good.\\nSo I think it's important in this debate that obviously there are going to be some benefits and some drawbacks to different types of ADHD management, but I think that what we're really looking at is what's going to be better or worse on balance.\\nSo we're going to tell you that using things like therapy and drugs to treat ADHD is ultimately going to do more harm, particularly for young people, than allowing them to grow up and learn to cope with this on their own.\\nSo two main arguments for you.\\nThe first is about over medication and the problems that it brings.\\nRecognize that in countries like the US and britain, hundreds of thousands of children have been put on to ADHD medications which fundamentally change their personality and how they look at the world.\\nWe tell you that oftentimes children who are on these drugs feel unhappy because they're not used to this new mental state and because they don't feel like themselves.\\nWe think that at the end of the day the unhappiness that this causes children it's going to do more damage to them growing up than it would to have to cope with this ADHD.\\nWe think that it's likely to lead to people questioning their self worth, people having a hard time connecting with their peers and their family, and that ultimately the disutility of this unhappiness is going to be greater than the utility created from the happiness of being able to focus on something a little bit longer.\\nWe also think that you're likely to see a loss of creativity as a result of this over medication.\\nThat young people are likely to lose out on talents that they might have developed otherwise and generally be less able to explore and develop themselves into the person that they ultimately want to become.\\nBut on top of that when we say over medication we think that doctors are often too quick to prescribe ADHD medications to parents who don't know how to deal with, perhaps, unruly children.\\nWe think that many times these drugs are a band-aid solution to get children to behave when what we really need to do is look at the root causes of their difficulty focusing or poor behavior.\\nWe think that, although not always, these drugs can be a crutch for lazy parenting or bad teachers and things like that and that what would really be best for the children would be to address the root cause rather than to just use these medications as an easy way to get out of a difficult problem.\\nOur second argument is about the long term drawbacks of relying on these different types of ADHD treatments so the other team tells you that in recent years the prevalence of ADHD has increased, but I'm going to push back on this idea.\\nWe tell you that it's very likely that in the past many people had ADHD and were able to cope with it either because society was different or because ultimately they were able to learn to cope with this and people around them were able to help them deal with it.\\nWe think that if society has changed that medicating people won't solve the ills that underlie the problem in society and that we need to identify those problems rather than just ask individual people to change everything about themselves.\\nBut in terms of these long term drawbacks, we think that it's likely that individuals will form a dependence on these medications.\\nThat when you learn how to cope with the world when you're taking adderall or ritalin, that it's very likely that you won't be able to cope with the world without those drugs.\\nSo when you give them to children in particular, you set them up for a lifetime of dependence on these medications.\\nNow they haven't been around that long.\\nWe don't know what the side effects might be of taking these medications for twenty, thirty, even forty years, and on top of that we tell you that it's likely to be inconvenient for people to continue to rely on them into adulthood at times when they need to travel or otherwise wouldn't be able to carry these drugs with them.\\nWe think that, if anything, the types of treatments that the other team tells you about prevent people from learning to cope with their condition in a way that they probably would without medication.\\nWe think that encouraging people to solve their problems from within would ultimately be preferable.\\nWe're willing to acknowledge that some people with very serious cases of ADHD might need these treatments but in general, we think they do more harm than good for most people.\\nThank you.  \n",

we acknowledge that there are good and bad things about internet censorship.\\nWe think that our burden is to tell you why the good outweighs the harm, not that there are no harms, and that the inverse is true for the other side.\\nThree arguments for you.\\nThe first is that internet censorship is a powerful tool to maintain government authority.\\nWe tell you that many countries around the world have governments which would face extreme opposition if people had access to information available from other countries media.\\nWe tell you that countries like russia and iran, for instance, have people who have limited access to the internet who may not fully understand the implications of their country's actions abroad, or things that their country is done on their behalf.\\nThe other team might tell you that it's good if people have this information so that they can remove harmful governments, but we tell you that no good is likely to come of people trying to overthrow their governments or rise up against a dictator because of information that they see online.\\nWe tell you that it's very likely, first of all, that these uprisings will fail like many of the arab spring uprisings, or that even if they succeed that ultimately the new governments changes that they put into place will be worse than what preceded because of the harms incurred during the transitional period.\\nAgain I would point to the arab spring.\\nWe see that back in two thousand eleven people were very hopeful about the outcomes of the arab spring but that ultimately what ended up happening was not very much positive change for people and we see that it probably would have been better in most cases if these governments had remained in place without the conflicts that emerged.\\nWe think that if internet censorship is a tool to avoid future arab spring-esk conflicts that we would be okay with that on our side of the debate.\\nOur second argument is about protecting people from dangerous information.\\nSo the distinction I want to make is that while the last argument is about political information, this argument is about pragmatic information.\\nWe think that governments are well within their rights to censor access to things like information on how to build a bomb, or steal a car, or otherwise put society at risk.\\nWe tell you that a lot of trouble making behavior is limited by people's access to information.\\nThat once upon a time only people who are gang members or part of organized crime would have been able to learn how to steal a car, or how to build a bomb, things like that, but that today because of the internet things like the anarchist cookbook had been widely distributed and everyone in free countries has access to this information.\\nWe think that ultimately it would be preferable to live in a world where fewer people knew how to partake in antisocial behaviors or potentially violent behaviors and that because the internet facilitates those things some censorship is in order to prevent access to them.\\nSo we would be broadly in favor of censorship of things like the anarchist cookbook or similar antisocial behavior promoting materials.\\nOur last argument is about preventing cultural conflict.\\nRecognize that things like the consumption of internet pornography have created large divides in many countries around the world, that we see that families have put a lot of pressure on people to not consume this material and that ultimately many people from conservative backgrounds want to ban it entirely.\\nWe think that in countries where many people are in favor of banning pornography or limiting access to it that ultimately it would be, first of all, correct for governments to do so because it reflects democratic will and second of all, because if a certain culture is very conservative, we think that it's not beneficial to have material that will create cultural descent.\\nUltimately we think that this will just lead to infighting and divisions within a country which might otherwise be more unified and thus have less violence and other problems.\\nSo for these reasons, ultimately, we think that internet censorship brings more good than harm.\\nWe think that the benefits to state stability will outweigh the limitations to personal freedom and we think that limiting access to troublesome information will also be a on balance good thing.\\nThank you.  \n",

          International adoption brings more good than harm because first, it gives incredible benefits for the children who are actually being adopted, it gives them a much better life, and second, I think that international adoption is also good for society, I think that it's good for combatting societal problems like overpopulation, and I also think that it leads to better social integration, diversity and nationalistic understanding.\\nSo, before I get into those arguments though, I want to talk about what this means.\\nBecause something bringing more good than harm doesn't mean that it's going to be perfect.\\nObviously there are going to be problems like human trafficking, these things exist, and obviously these things are bad.\\nHowever, these are still things that I think can be fought with regulation, fought with law enforcement, and I don't think that these are things that are necessarily inherent to international adoption in the same way that the benefits are, and therefore it's something that we should necessarily strive to keep and strive to make better, but not eliminate or lessen.\\nSo let's start by talking about why international adoption is great for the kids that are being adopted.\\nBecause recognize that a lot of these people are coming from objectively bad circumstances.\\nThey are coming from circumstances where there's a lack of hard resources for them, there could be shortages of food, shortages of water, shortages of education or healthcare services, either in the countries as whole, or more specifically problems as a result of underfunding of systems for underfunding of like a domestic support systems for adopted people and foster care systems.\\nAnd in addition to that, I also think that there is the psychological elements that come with a lack of the lack of human love in the same way, for the lack of a family, the lack of connections in the same way, that's also important.\\nAnd obviously adoption corrects these things, because you usually see these adoptions taking place from like more like infertile western families, or like do-gooders in the west.\\nAnd I think that this is good, because these tend to be people who have access to more resources, have access to higher qualities and standards of living, so you're directly making the lives of children better.\\nThere it's hard to argue that that's an incredibly important and good thing to do.\\nI also think that parents are going to give these children a lot of love.\\nI think that in a lot of ways it's going to be even a higher order of love.\\nBecause it's going to be a love that you essentially create as a result of being with that person and being a part of this person's life for since their since their birth, even if they weren't naturally born, through all their childhood.\\nYou're still gonna witness all of their like evolutions of life in the same way, you're still going to be a constant guiding force throughout their life.\\nThis is still parenting and love and human connections in an incredibly meaningful way and an incredibly enriching thing.\\nThe next thing that I'm going to talk about is how this is going to help society more broadly though, because I think that this is pretty important too.\\nFirst, I think that adoption is just good because, as opposed to natural birth, it does more to help with overpopulation, because you're not you're like not just adding more people to the world.\\nThis is obviously good, because you don't want overpopulation because there's health concerns associated with it, with like higher densities and things like that, there's environmental concerns with humans using too much too many resources and the like.\\nSo all that's important, but there's also the matter of diversity and cultural understanding, and I think one of the biggest things that leads to a lot of conflicts around the world is we tend to put ourselves in boxes and isolate ourselves.\\nAnd I think that when you have more immigration, when you have more adoption of international communities and things like this, this means you're more likely going to have a real human face and a real personal connection with the people that may be on the other side of the world even.\\nAnd this is a much better way to actually foster intercultural understanding, foster intercultural relations, and all of those things are, besides just being in more enriching for like your life, because you're learning more about the world, I think it's better for like international relations and the like as well.\\nSo for all those reasons, very proud to propose.  \n",

the deficit, and an increase in the debt, and I think that this is bad, and wildly irresponsible, and second, because I think that it used up a lot of political capital, that necessarily came at the expense of better focused plans, that actually would lead to long term solutions to problems that we face.\\nSo, let's start by talking about the problem of debt and deficit.\\nI think that this is incredibly important, because whenever you you whenever you increase the deficit, it leads to, on a yearly basis, it leads to, overtime, a greater and greater accumulation of debt.\\nSo, this is a problem.\\nBecause eventually, you're going to have to pay off this debt.\\nWhen people lend you money, people eventually want that money back.\\nNot only do they want that money back, but they expect to get more money back than they originally got.\\nThat's the way in which this works.\\nSo, there's first obvious financial implication that is associated with this, because the status quo, with like american society, for a long time has been: oh we need to spend more money on something?\\nWell then, we'll just borrow more money.\\nOh we need to repay that money?\\nThen let's borrow more money.\\nSo first, this creates the problem with like over time, you're only going to see these costs go up and up, because borrowing money is in of itself an expensive act, and you're going to have to eventually pay that money back, and you're eventually losing more money, because you're going to pay that money back.\\nBut, this is also an unfair way in which like, the burden it's going to be putting on people, because the primary burden, of paying this money back, is going to be on younger americans, it is going to be on millennials, it's going to be on the next generation, and I think that's very very bad and very very irresponsible, because first, they're they're not the people who are primarily getting the benefits of this, like young people are not primarily the ones who are going to be the beneficiaries of these jobs, young people aren't going to be the ones that are actually going to get a lot of this like economic help as a result of this job and stimulus act, but those are the people who are going to have to pay for all this debt spending in the long run, and I think this is incredibly bad, because this isn't our fault.\\nIt's not young people's fault, that all of these costs are the recruited value, and it's not fair to put the spending all this who aren't not only benefiting the problem, but never really got a choice in this spending in the first place, because of the like m asymmetrical political power that younger people have.\\nI also think that that's like incredibly immoral.\\nBut, in addition to all of that, I also think that the american jobs act was bad, because of the way in which it used up a lot of political capital for a bad focus.\\nSo when you're trying to pass a bill, its the like the jobs act, I think then it was like very poorly focused, in that it focused on short term things, that aren't ultimately creating long term good jobs, like infrastructure projects, which may be good in some senses, but they're ultimately not going to actually lead to sustainable jobs, they're are not jobs that people can actually make a career out of, so that's not all that good.\\nBut, I additionally think that, it was primarily just repair focused in nature, it was primarily just repairing roads, repairing energy things, like that, and of repairing like energy grids and things like that, and like, I think that that's like important, because when you create like a new energy grid per se, you're just increasing our ability to rely on the ways in which we already get energy, like you're increasing our ability to rely on oil or gas or things like that.\\nWhat this does is it de de emphasizes a focus on alternative sources of energy.\\nWhen you repair roads, you increase the likelihood and ease of using a car, so people are going to be less likely to rely on alternative forms of education, of like transportation, things like that, and that's where a lot of this goes, and I think that all that bad.\\nSo for those reasons, the american jobs act was bad.  \n",

        Same-sex marriage brings more good than harm.\\nNot allowing a couple of consensual adults to marry each other because other people disapprove of their relationship is the definition of absurd.\\nThe state has no business in telling me who I should live with.\\nThe ban on gay marriage isn't only discriminative to same-sex couples, it also humiliates them and refuses them the very basic dignity of acknowledging that their love is equal to that of any other couple.\\nTwo arguments in this speech: firstly, on discrimination by humiliation and secondly, on like what about religious people's feelings?\\nFirst argument: I have no intention to speak of whether marriage is a basic right or not.\\nAs far as I care, the state can say that as of today, no one gets married.\\nBut it seems fairly simple that if some people are allowed to marry, then everyone should be able to do so.\\nPersonally, I do not see any supreme importance in this institution.\\nI think that it's just a symbolic thing.\\nThe point is that the moment that this custom is adopted and even somewhat glorified by society, then it doesn't matter anymore.\\nThe fact that society awards this ritual with so much meaning and like is what gives it its meaning, because all of us want to feel a part of society.\\nAll of us want to go through the same rituals that everybody else goes through so that we feel we belong.\\nBy denying a certain group this ceremony, the message they are getting is: you guys are not a part of us, you're not like us, you're unwelcome.\\nJust like so many other cases of discrimination, it's not about the thing itself that's being denied, but rather about the feeling that this denial creates.\\nThink of a business that refuses to serve african americans, for example.\\nThere are a million other places that these people can go to, right?\\nBut the problem isn't that we've denied them this particular service, but that we've treated them as less deserving.\\nThis is what's so bad about discrimination, and this is also why when opposes to gay marriage innocently offer all kinds of alternatives that give it a different name, like civil partnership or whatever.\\nWe say, \" you know what, you can shove it. \"\\nExcuse my french.\\nThat's just like like the separate but equal policy.\\nSeparate isn't equal, and until we give it the exact same name, then this will continue to be used as a tool to distinguish between what's considered normal and what isn't, and this is unacceptable to us.\\nSecond argument: the main source of opposition to gay marriage has always been religion.\\nNow, there are those who claim that this isn't god's intention and blah blah.\\nI'm not honoring that with a reponse.\\nWhat I will do, though, is answer what I believe to be the strongest argument in regard to religion and that is that marriage is essentially a religious institution that requires , you know, registers that are often religious people and therefore, it's unfair to demand that they perform ceremonies or sign papers contrary to their religious , you know, beliefs or conscience.\\nSo, in short, let's call it the kim davis example, you know, after the famous clerk from kentucky.\\nOur answer is twofold.\\nA: we believe this is a simple that can easily be solved by saying that every public servant that can't fulfill his job according to the law and refuses to operate in an indiscriminatory fashion should just resign and remove himself in favor of someone who will.\\nBut but second answer, and that's the deeper answer that addresses also the balance between religious feelings and same-sex couples, we say we say the following: whenever there is a clash between two different lifestyles, or rather two groups that have the same set of beliefs that can't coexist, you know, where you can't please one group without harming the other, we should always prioritize the group that's not denying the other group.\\nTo put it in kindergarten terms, we ought prioritize whoever didn't start it.\\nSame-sex couples ask for no trouble.\\nThey're not trying to tell religious people how to lead their lives or that they shouldn't be religious.\\nThey just want to be treated equally.\\nAs far as they're concerned, everyone could have gotten along perfectly but sadly, they do not get symmetric treatment from the religious community that that to begin with, say that the problem is with the gays' lifestyles and they should change or be discriminated.\\nThis is not a legitimate belief belief.\\nThis is bullying and we should we should not be considerate towards it.\\nFor all of these, please propose.  \n",

   Private universities bring more good than harm.\\nSo, when we're talking about private universities, we think that, any non public university is fair for debate within this round, we think that includes both for profit, and not for profit institutions, and so, we would say that on balance, between all those institutions, private universities bring more good than harm.\\nSo firstly, what we want to talk about is the right to education, and the right to choice in education, and secondly, we are going to talk about the tangible impacts that come from private universities.\\nSo firstly, on choice.\\nSo we think that, people should have the ability to choose where they want to go to be educated.\\nEducation is a crucial function of being able to be socially mobile, to be economically mobile within a society, and to better oneself, and attain employment.\\nSo, given that it is such a crucial part and a crucial aspect of life as we know it, within our societies, we think that people should have the autonomy and the choice, to choose where they're going to go.\\nWe would say that private universities, not only offer more variety to those choices, but also ensures that you have competition for public institutions.\\nWe think that, if all upper if all education, all university education, came simply from public institutions, we think there would be very little check on these institutions, and therefore we think that it's likely that these institutions would be prone to a number of harms, including corruption, trying to be trying to gain money through these public institutions.\\nWe think prices could possibly go up, when there's no check on the prices of these institutions, and more importantly when there's no competition to draw these students, you don't have to focus as hard and as much on trying to improve those educational institutions.\\nSo we think that, private universities are good, simply by their existence, regardless of whether or not there are external benefits, that we would say there are, simply because it provides competition that is desperately needed to check public institutions.\\nBut, what do we think are the true benefits a private universities?\\nSo, we think that private universities have the benefit of being able to draw upon: one, a very long history that allows for more donations, what this looks like tangibly is the fact that harvard, yale, and other ivy league, and non ivy league institutions are often much older than the public institutions that we have, which means that there's more prestige to these institutions, and it allows for a larger conglomeration of great minds in in our academic spheres, and insures that there was a long, and illustrious, history of donors that are willing to give to these institutions, and these institutions are crucial for academic scientific research, and things that allow for our society to progress.\\nMany of the advancements, that have come scientifically, have come from private universities, and private research, that is done by those universities, because these universities have a profit incentive oftentimes, to be as productive as possible, to produce as much research as possible, to have as much academic prestige as possible, because this is how they draw both more more donations, and how they draw undergraduates, who end up paying into the college itself.\\nWe think that, when there is this competition, when there's this competition, and a profit incentive that only private universities are going to have, within that you're more likely to get tangible academic research that has real benefits, things like, scientific progress, medical research that isn't driven simply by selling a product, but also motivated by being able to produce tangible gains for society writ large.\\nWe think that, the profit incentive, that these universities do, is different from private businesses, in that they're they're is not simply trying to sell a product, though sometimes they will create products, but they create broad tangible advancements, that can then be applied to many different spheres of life, in different economic sectors, that will, in the long run, be more beneficial.\\nThe fact that, these universities uniquely have the ability to draw in donors, in a way that public institutions do not, especially because they are a large place, for wealthy individuals to conglomerate, and therefore a place where wealth will often flow into at a rate that public universities simply will not have.\\nWe think that, on balance, private universities bring more good than harm.  \n",
